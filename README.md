### Web Developer

I am an enthusistic and creative web developer with hands on skills in a wide range of software, tools, and programming languages. I spend most of my day, experimenting with HTML, CSS and Javascript (and it's endless list of frameworks). I enjoy coding and the challenge of learning something new everyday.  

##### Currently learning Angular.js.
